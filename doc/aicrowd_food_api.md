## Code repository

The main code repository for the AICrowd Food API is hosted on a [gitlab.aicrowd.com](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/food-recognition-challenge/food-recognition-api-v1).

We also have a backup of this repository on our [GitHub account](https://github.com/digitalepidemiologylab/aicrowd-food-api).

## ML models backup

On the main [repository](#code-repository), [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) is used to store the ML models. Due to GitHub limit to max 4Go files, we can't do the same on our GitHub repository backup. So we use S3 to backup ML models:

* Bucket: `myfoodrepo-backup`
* Folder: `aicrowd-ml-models`
* Storage class: `Glacier Flexible Retrieval` (formerly Glacier)
