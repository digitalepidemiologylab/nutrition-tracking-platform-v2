# Log management (Papertrail)

We use [Papertrail](https://my.papertrailapp.com/) for log management and search through a Papertrail lab account identified by `salathe-devadmin@groupes.epfl.ch` (credentials in 1Password).

This allows us to share access with external contributors (_ie_ Liip developers of the mobile Android app) something not possible with Heroku Papertrail add-on.
